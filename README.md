# Broswer_History_Analyzer

This program uses python's built-in module SQLite3. It uses simple SQL select queries to retrieve each website you have visited from the database. The program then parses the data, scans for duplicates and counts how many times each website was accessed. It then displays the data in an output or it plots the data using matplotlib. 

There are many possibilities when it comes to the SQL browser tables including date and time accessed and the origin of the visit. 

Future advancements of the program could include OOP integration to store the whole table for each website. Please let me know if you have any suggestions :)
